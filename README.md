# Loading Bar
In this project, we’ll create a loading bar. Upon opening, you’ll see a header, loading percentage, and the progress bar. Refresh the page to watch the percentage increase from 0 to 100, filling the bar. You can use this as a free loader or integrate it into your own projects. Learn how to change the numbers and bar width with JavaScript. <br> <br> <br> Link: https://diegonoxe.github.io/LoadingBar/ <br> Original Project: https://demo.100jsprojects.com/loading-bar
