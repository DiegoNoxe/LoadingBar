# LoadingBar
 In this project, we'll create a loading bar. Upon opening, you'll see a header, loading percentage, and bar. Refresh the page to watch the percentage increase from 0 to 100, filling the bar. Use it as a free loader or in your own projects. Learn to change the numbers and bar width with JavaScript.
